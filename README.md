# fhda-finance-forms

## to-do
- [X] script to download all PDFs from target link (fhda finance forms main page)
- [X] script to ask user to describe the task, pass input and list of downloaded forms to Bedrock client, and suggest top 3 forms to user
- [ ] script to guide user through filling out selected form

## ideas for further development
- forms can be formatted in .txt or .csv, which would be easier for LLMs to process
- program can be expanded to include all forms on the site (this is a proof of concept)
- if this is integrated into the website, user data while logged in (name, user ID, etc) can be auto-populated, further streamlining the process
